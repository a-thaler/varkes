# Commerce Mock
This is an example of using the open-api mock with the E-commerce specification
only the following endpoints are implemented from the spec. (contain default values) besides the basics defined in the open-api [README](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/varkes/blob/master/openapi-mock/README.md)

- http://localhost:10000/rest/v2/{baseSiteId}/cardtypes

- http://localhost:10000/rest/v2/{baseSiteId}/catalogs/{catalogId}/{catalogVersionId}/categories/{categoryId}

- http://localhost:10000/rest/v2/{baseSiteId}/languages

The complete specification is included if you want to try more endpoints
