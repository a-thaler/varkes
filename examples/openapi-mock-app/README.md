# OpenAPI Mock App
This is an example of using the open-api mock with swagger specification that lists courses
only the following endpoints are implemented from the spec. (contain default values) besides the basics defined in the open-api [README](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/varkes/blob/master/openapi-mock/README.md)

- http://localhost:10000/entity/courses

- http://localhost:10000/entity/coursesbyId/{id}

The complete specification is included if you want to try more endpoints
