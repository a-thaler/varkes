# OData Mock App
This is an example of using the odata-api mock with edmx specification that lists courses
only the following endpoints are implemented from the spec. (contain default values) besides the basics defined in the odata-api [README](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/varkes/blob/master/odata-mock/README.md)

- http://localhost:3000/odata/Courses

- http://localhost:3000/odata/Courses(#id)

The complete specification is included if you want to try more endpoints
