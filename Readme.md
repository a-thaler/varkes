# Varkes
*Varkes* means small boats in contrast to the big ships. We are building a framework/toolkit of components, which then mock the big ships (applications).
## App Connector
App connector has a REST api that is used to get certificate from kyma cluster. You can run it with `npm start` or you can use the *Dockerfile* to create a docker image. Further instructions are in [app-connector/Readme.md](app-connector/Readme.md)

## OpenAPI Mock
